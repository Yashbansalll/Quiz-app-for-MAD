# QuizBook
QuizBook is an Android app in which users can play quizzes is 10 different categories with nearly 300 questions in total.
This repository is made for the purpose to showcase my project for learning purposes and should not be used commercially.

The salient features of the app are:
   1. Login is provided to the user so that only that person can access the app.
   2. Timer for the quiz to make the quizzing more interesting.
   3. User can see own best score in different categories.
   4. App also has a beautiful sound option that can also be muted.
   5. User can contact the developer of the app for any queries.
   6. User can also share the app among their friends by email.
   
### **I also highly recommend you to suggest some improvements in the project.**
